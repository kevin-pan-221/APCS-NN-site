            Transformers are a type of neural network designed for handling sequential data, 
            such as text. They use a mechanism called self-attention 
            to weigh the importance of words in a sentence, vastly increasing its efficiency and making
            it perfect for natural language processing tasks. This is the type of model used in LLMs
            like GPT.
